# Json2Pojo-Pojo2Json-using-Java-Spring-Jackson
In this project, I have used Spring Jackson to convert JSON object in a file to Java POJO as well as a Java POJO object to JSON object and wrote it to a file using Netbeans 11.3

# How to run this project :

1- Download this project and open it in Netbeans 11.3

2- To convert from JSON to POJO, run the 'Driver.java' class in 'JsonToPojo' package. The JSON object in the data/sample.json file will be converted in Student class and will be printed to console.

3- To convert from POJO to JSON, run the 'Driver.java' class in 'PojoToJson' package. The Java POJO class will be converted to JSON object and will be written to data/output.json
